# Decision Tree Prediction with Visualization

This repository contains code and resources for predicting using decision trees and visualizing them on Google Colab. Decision trees are powerful machine learning models that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

# Introduction

In this project, we provide a Python script that demonstrates how to build a decision tree model using the popular scikit-learn library and dtreeviz library. The script includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and visualization of the decision tree.

The decision tree algorithm recursively partitions the dataset based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure of decision nodes and leaf nodes. The decision nodes contain the conditions for splitting the data, while the leaf nodes represent the final predictions.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which was introduced by the statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It is a multivariate dataset that includes measurements of 150 Iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The dataset is commonly used for classification tasks and is available in various machine learning libraries and repositories.

# Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. Import all the dependencies which are required .


2. 'data/' : This directory contains the Iris dataset in CSV format.

3. We analysis dataset.

4. We Visualized dataset by plotting graphs from famous library called Seaborn and matplotlib.

5. The dataset is split into two files: 'df_train.csv' for training the model and 'df_test.csv' for evaluating the model's performance.

6. Apply Decision Tree algorithm and predicting the dataset and check accuarcy.

7. Visualized the decision tree by using library of scikit learn and dtreeviz.

# Conclusion

This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques for classifying Iris flowers based on their measurements. By following the instructions provided, you can reproduce the model, evaluate its performance, and use it to make predictions on new data.

Also Understanding the new concept of dtreeviz library which give nice visualization of decision tree.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as per your requirements. Enjoy classifying Iris flowers with machine learning!
